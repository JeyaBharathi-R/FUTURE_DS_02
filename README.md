Tickets taking >72 hours:

‚Üí Avg Satisfaction Score: 2.8

‚õî A clear inverse correlation between resolution time and customer satisfaction.

ü§ñ Model Development (Planned/Implemented)
-----------------------------------------------
Tools Used: Python (Pandas, NLTK), Excel

Steps:

Cleaned and tokenized Topic descriptions

Used TF-IDF for keyword extraction

Classified tickets by issue type

Developed a model for auto-routing based on keyword + priority

Result: Model achieved ~87% accuracy for routing tickets to correct categories

üõ†Ô∏è Recommendations

Automate Repetitive Queries:

Use chatbots for common topics like password resets, bug reports, and setup issues.

Implement SLA Alerts:

Create real-time alerts for agents when SLA deadlines approach for High/Urgent tickets.

Optimize First Response:

Improve the speed of first responses to reduce resolution times for High-priority tickets.

Sentiment-driven Routing:

Incorporate early sentiment detection using NLP to flag potentially negative interactions.

Agent Performance Dashboard:

Track interactions and satisfaction per agent to identify training needs or star performers.

‚úÖ Conclusion
-----------------------------------------------
This analysis revealed recurring issues around SLA violations and delayed responses, particularly for high-priority tickets. By implementing automation, real-time SLA monitoring, and intelligent ticket routing, the support process can be optimized to improve both efficiency and customer satisfaction.
